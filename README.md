# ntp-atlas-pcap

* So Marco Davids found another bug with [Atlas NTP  measurements](https://mailman.ripe.net/archives/list/ripe-atlas@ripe.net/thread/33KNP7KPXN3YKUSEFTQGJMKVEHJAKX3Q/)
* IN short: most probes do not report results against his server
* He collected some pcap from a measurement
* I'll compare it here to see if they match
